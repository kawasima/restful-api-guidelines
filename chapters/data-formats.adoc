[#167]
== {MUST} Use JSON to Encode Structured Data

Use JSON-encoded body payload for transferring structured data. The JSON
payload must follow https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159[RFC-7159] by
having (if possible) a serialized object as the top-level structure,
since it would allow for future extension. This also applies for
collection resources where one naturally would assume an array. See <<161>> for
an example.

[#168]
== {MAY} Use non JSON Media Types for Binary Data or Alternative Content Representations

Other media types may be used in following cases:

* Transferring binary data or data whose structure is not relevant. This is
the case if payload structure is not interpreted and consumed by clients as is.
Example of such use case is downloading images in formats JPG, PNG, GIF.
* In addition to JSON version alternative data representations (e.g. in
formats PDF, DOC, XML) may be made available through content
negotiation.

[#172]
== {SHOULD} Prefer standard Media type name `application/json`

Previously, this guideline allowed the use of custom media types like 
`application/x.zalando.article+json`. This usage is not recommended
anymore and should be avoided, except where it is necessary for cases of
<<114,media type versioning>>. Instead, just use the standard media type name
`application/json` (or `application/problem+json` for <<176>>).

Custom media types beginning with `x` bring no advantage
compared to the standard media type for JSON, and make automated
processing more difficult. They are also
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838#section-3.4[discouraged by RFC
6838].

[#169]
== {MUST} Use Standard Date and Time Formats

Read more about date and time format in <<126>>.

[[http-headers]]
=== HTTP headers

Http headers including the proprietary headers use the
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1[HTTP date format
defined in RFC 7231].

[#170]
== {MAY} Use Standards for Country, Language and Currency Codes

Use the following standard formats for country, language and currency
codes:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2[ISO 3166-1-alpha2
country codes]
** (It is "GB", not "UK", even though "UK" has seen some use at Zalando)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes[ISO 639-1
language code]
** https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47[BCP-47] (based on ISO 639-1) for
language variants
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217[ISO 4217 currency codes]

[#171]
== {MUST} Define Format for Type Number and Integer

Whenever an API defines a property of type `number` or `integer`, the
precision must be defined by the format as follows to prevent clients
from guessing the precision incorrectly, and thereby changing the value
unintentionally:

[cols="15%,15%,70%",options="header",]
|=====================================================================
|type |format |specified value range
|integer |int32 |integer between pass:[-2<sup>31</sup>] and pass:[2<sup>31</sup>]-1
|integer |int64 |integer between pass:[-2<sup>63</sup>] and pass:[2<sup>63</sup>]-1
|integer |bigint |arbitrarily large signed integer number
|number |float |IEEE 754-2008/ISO 60559:2011 binary64 decimal number
|number |double |IEEE 754-2008/ISO 60559:2011 binary128 decimal number
|number |decimal |arbitrarily precise signed decimal number
|=====================================================================

The precision must be translated by clients and servers into the most
specific language types. E.g. for the following definitions the most
specific language types in Java will translate to `BigDecimal` for
`Money.amount` and `int` or `Integer` for the `OrderList.page_size`:

[source,yaml]
----
Money:
  type: object
  properties:
    amount:
      type: number
      description: Amount expressed as a decimal number of major currency units
      format: decimal
      example: 99.95
   ...

OrderList:
  type: object
  properties:
    page_size:
      type: integer
      description: Number of orders in list
      format: int32
      example: 42
