This section describes a handful of headers, which we found raised the
most questions in our daily usage, or which are useful in particular
circumstances but not widely known.

== {MUST} 正しいContentヘッダを使う

Contentやエンティティに関するヘッダには、`Content-`のプレフィクスが付いています。
これらにはメッセージボディの内容に関することが書かれていて、HTTPリクエストとレスポンスの両方で使用されます。
共通的に使われるContentヘッダは次のようなものですが、その限りではありません。

* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6266[`Content-Disposition`] はファイルとして
indicate that the representation is supposed to be saved as a file, and
the proposed file name.
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.2.2[`Content-Encoding`]
はContentに適用される圧縮/暗号アルゴリズムを示します。
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2[`Content-Length`]
はContentの長さをbyte長で示します。
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.3.2[`Content-Language`]
indicates that the body is meant for people literate in some human
language(s).
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.4.2[`Content-Location`]
indicates where the body can be found otherwise
(<<179>> for more details]).
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-4.2[`Content-Range`] is
used in responses to range requests to indicate which part of the
requested resource representation is delivered with the body.
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5[`Content-Type`]
indicates the media type of the body content.

[#179]
== {MAY} Content-Location ヘッダを使う

The Content-Location header is _optional_ and can be used in successful
write operations (PUT, POST or PATCH) or read operations (GET, HEAD) to
guide caching and signal a receiver the actual location of the resource
transmitted in the response body. This allows clients to identify the
resource and to update their local copy when receiving a response with
this header.

The Content-Location header can be used to support the following use
cases:

* For reading operations GET and HEAD, a different location than the
requested URI can be used to indicate that the returned resource is
subject to content negotiations, and that the value provides a more
specific identifier of the resource.
* For writing operations PUT and PATCH, an identical location to the
requested URI, can be used to explicitly indicate that the returned
resource is the current representation of the newly created or updated
resource.
* For writing operations POST and DELETE, a content location can be used
to indicate that the body contains a status report resource in response
to the requested action, which is available at provided location.

*Note*: When using the Content-Location header, the Content-Type header
has to be set as well. For example:

[source,http]
----
GET /products/123/images HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: image/png
Content-Location: /products/123/images?format=raw
----

[#180]
== {SHOULD} Content-Locationの代わりにLocationヘッダを使う

As the correct usage of Content-Location with respect to semantics and
caching is difficult, we _discourage_ the use of Content-Location. In
most cases it is sufficient to direct clients to the resource location
by using the Location header instead without hitting the
Content-Location specific ambiguities and complexities.

More details in RFC 7231
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.2[7.1.2 Location],
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.4.2[3.1.4.2
Content-Location]

[#181]
== {MAY} Use the Prefer header to indicate processing preferences

The `Prefer` header defined in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240[RFC7240] allows clients to request
processing behaviors from servers.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240[RFC7240] pre-defines a number of
preferences and is extensible, to allow others to be defined. Support
for the Prefer header is entirely optional and at the discretion of API
designers, but as an existing Internet Standard, is recommended over
defining proprietary "X-" headers for processing directives.

The `Prefer` header can defined like this in an API definition:

[source,yaml]
----
Prefer:
  name: Prefer
  description: |
    The RFC7240 Prefer header indicates that particular server
    behaviors are preferred by the client but are not required
    for successful completion of the request.
    # (indicate the preferences supported by the API)

  in: header
  type: string
  required: false
----

Supporting APIs may return the `Preference-Applied` header also defined
in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240[RFC7240] to indicate whether the
preference was applied.

[#182]
== {MAY} Consider Using ETag Together With If-Match/If-None-Match Header

When creating or updating resources it may be necessary to expose
conflicts and to prevent the 'lost update' or 'initially created' problem.
Following https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232[RFC 7232 "HTTP: Conditional Requests"]
this can be best accomplished by using the
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-2.3[`ETag`] header together
with the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-3.1[`If-Match`] or
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-3.2[`If-None-Match`] conditional header. The
contents of an `ETag: <entity-tag>` header is either (a) a hash of the
response body, (b) a hash of the last modified field of the entity, or
(c) a version number or identifier of the entity version.

To expose conflicts between concurrent update operations via PUT, POST,
or PATCH, the `If-Match: <entity-tag>` header can be used to force the
server to check whether the version of the updated entity is conforming
to the requested `<entity-tag>`. If no matching entity is found, the
operation is supposed a to respond with status code 412 - precondition
failed.

Beside other use cases, the `If-None-Match:` header with parameter `*`
can be used in a similar way to expose conflicts in resource creation.
If any matching entity is found, the operation is supposed a to respond
with status code 412 - precondition failed.

The `ETag`, `If-Match`, and `If-None-Match` headers can be defined as
follows in the API definition:

[source,yaml]
----
Etag:
  name: Etag
  description: |
    The RFC7232 ETag header field in a response provides the current entity-
    tag for the selected resource. An entity-tag is an opaque identifier for
    different versions of a resource over time, regardless whether multiple
    versions are valid at the same time. An entity-tag consists of an opaque
    quoted string, possibly prefixed by a weakness indicator.

  in: header
  type: string
  required: false
  example: W/"xy", "5", "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70"

IfMatch:
  name: If-Match
  description: |
    The RFC7232 If-Match header field in a request requires the server to
    only operate on the resource that matches at least one of the provided
    entity-tags. This allows clients express a precondition that prevent
    the method from being applied if there have been any changes to the
    resource.

  in: header
  type: string
  required: false
  example:  "5", "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70"

IfNoneMatch:
  name: If-None-Match
  description: |
    The RFC7232 If-None-Match header field in a request requires the server
    to only operate on the resource if it does not match any of the provided
    entity-tags. If the provided entity-tag is `*`, it is required that the
    resource does not exist at all.

  in: header
  type: string
  required: false
  example: "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70", *
